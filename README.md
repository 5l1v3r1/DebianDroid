#DebianDroid

Debian Android app for gsoc2013.

##Possible use cases

 1. Bob takes the train every day, and checks his mail on the ride in, on his Android phone. A lot of Bob's mail is Debian related, containing links to the BTS, PTS, and other related Debian websites. Bob wishes to get the information presented on the site in a way that looks native (and clear to read), as well as cached, since his cell network connection is expensive. Bob may also go through long tunnels without service, where it'd be nice to have an offline copy of things he's been to before.
 2. Anne is a package maintainer of a few Python modules. These modules are not very time intensive, but she wants to keep up with the team. Anne wants to be able to use her phone to get alerts that notify her about the state of the Python modules team, such as new uploads of the Python interpreter, so her packages can be tested for FTBFS bugs. Anne also wishes to use her phone to preform actions on the BTS, such as comment on a bug she knows something about, or mark a bug moreinfo. Anne understands the BTS is based on email.
 3. A sysadmin is in a datacenter with has only their phone. He needs to look up info on bug reports in the kernel because a server won't boot. 
 4. The app will also act as a tool to let people quickly find out their overlapping debian interests at debcamp/debconf or other meetups. If two people meet, they can quickly look up whether the packages they maintain are related at all. For example  maintain fooapp and I meet someone, we break Debiandroid and I quick scan the QRCode generated by the other app. It then shows me that fooapp depends on libbar, and the person I met maintains the libbar package.
 5. A "bug report alarm" button of some sort that will be used when you don't have time to write a full bug report via your smartphone but you are busy and don't want to forget it later on. A quick mobile way to file a pre-bug report so that you have less to do when you get infront of your main workstation.
